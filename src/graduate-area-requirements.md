# Graduate Area Requirements

[]()In order to ensure breadth in the course of study, the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability has set up area requirements in the disciplines of applied statistics, mathematical statistics, and probability.  Students may also choose to satisfy a pure mathematics area requirement offered by the Department of Mathematics.  The area requirements vary for each degree, specialization, and optional Ph.D. emphasis.  Consult with the Graduate Advisor or your committee chair as to which of these area requirements are appropriate for your proposed field of study, research, and degree objective.  Each area requirement consists of two parts:

- Completion of the Designated One-Year Graduate Sequence with a minimum grade of “B” or better in each class. Courses taken S/U will not satisfy this requirement
- A Qualifying Examination on both undergraduate and graduate material.  The qualifying examination is offered once a year, generally in spring or summer.  The examination is designed to test whether students have adequate knowledge of relevant material.  Each student has up to two attempts for each qualifying exam, and must successfully pass the requisite number of exams within three years of entering the department.

A detailed description of each of the four area requirements follows:

[Probability and Stochastic Processes](#probability)

- Sufficiency: factorization criterion, and minimal and complete sufficient statistics.
- Estimation: maximum likelihood and method of moments, uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators, Cramér-Rao inequality, Rao-Blackwell theorem, consistency, and asymptotic normality.
- Hypothesis testing:  Neyman-Pearson lemma, power functions, most powerful and uniformly most powerful tests.  General likelihood ratio tests and their asymptotic properties and asymptotic equivalents.
- Confidence intervals and prediction intervals.
- Nonparametric tests for one-sample, two-sample, and independence problems: chi-square tests for goodness of fit and contingency tables.
- Least squares principle: linear and non-linear regression and inferences based on them.
- Bayesian inference for estimation and hypothesis testing.
- Basic decision theory for estimation and hypothesis testing.

Additional topics as announced by the Qualifying Examination committee.

## []()4.  Pure Mathematics Area Requirements:

### Courses:

- MATH  201 A-B-C: Real Analysis
- MATH  202 A-B-C: Complex Analysis

### Qualifying Examination:

The Pure Mathematics qualifying examination is based on material found in the UCSB undergraduate courses MATH 118 A-B-C and MATH 122 A-B, and the UCSB graduate courses MATH 201 A-B-C and MATH 202 A-B-C.  This exam is administered by the Mathematics Department, and students planning to take this qualifying examination should contact the Mathematics Department to enquire about any changes in the format of this examination or topics.

The examination consists of two parts;

1. Topics in Real Analysis (The real number system, topology of R¬n, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, sequences and series, convergence processes including uniform convergence, functions of several variables, and introductions to metric spaces and to measure and integration).
2. Topics in Complex Analysis (Complex numbers and functions, Cauchy integral theorem and Cauchy's integral formula and consequences, Residue calculus, elementary conformal maps, power series and Laurent series, elementary properties of analytical continuation, zeros and singularities of analytic functions).

### Reference Material (Real Analysis)

- Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd ed. (covers all topics and more). The exam excludes 7.28-7.33, 8.15-8.22, and all of Chapter 10. From Chapter 6 the exam will cover only ordinary Riemann integration, not the more general Riemann-Stieltjes integral.
- Andrew Browder, Mathematical Analysis (Chapters 1-10).
- Robert Strichartz, The Way of Analysis (excluding Chapters 11, 12 and 15).

### Reference Material (Complex Analysis)

- Spiegel, Complex Variables, Schaum's Outline Series (covers all topics)
- Knopp and Konrad, Problem Book in the Theory of Functions, Vol. 1 &amp; 2 (an old book, but still an excellent source for problems)
