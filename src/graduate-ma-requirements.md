# MA Milestone Requirements

### Applied Statistics

To satisfy the area requirement in Applied Statistics, students must pass the Applied Statistics qualifying examination based on PSTAT 120A-B-C, 122, 126, and 220A-B-C. Students also must pass a specific data analysis project that the PSTAT 230 instructor designates will fulfill the degree project requirement. Students may attempt the qualifying exam twice.

### Mathematical Statistics

Mathematical Statistics students may follow either of two plans; Plan I (Thesis Option) or Plan II (Examination Option).

**Plan I - Thesis Option:** In addition to the course requirements, students must pass a comprehensive examination corresponding to one of the statistics area requirements, prepare an acceptable thesis under the supervision of a faculty member, and defend it before their Master’s Thesis Committee.  Before the end of their second quarter, Plan I students should form and nominate their thesis committee.  This committee should consist of a minimum of three members, at least two of whom must be ladder faculty from the Statistics and Applied Probability Department.  The committee will be formally nominated by the Department Chair and approved by the Graduate Dean.  While it should be nominated early in the student's graduate career, it will, in no case, be finalized later than the beginning of the final quarter of work.

Students may attempt the qualifying exam twice.

**Plan II - Examination Option:** In addition to the course requirements outlined above, students must pass two qualifying examinations corresponding to two of the statistics area requirements.

Students may attempt the qualifying exam twice.

### Data Science

To satisfy the area requirement in Data Science, students must pass the Applied Statistics qualifying examination based on PSTAT 120A-B-C, 122, 126, and 220A-B-C. Students also must pass a specific data analysis project that the PSTAT 230 instructor designates will fulfill the degree project requirement. Students may attempt the qualifying exam twice.
