# Faculty Research

The department’s research expertise ranges from theoretical probability and statistics to advanced applied data analysis techniques, computational statistics, and financial mathematics and statistics. This is reflected in the curriculum, which prepares undergraduate and graduate students for careers in the insurance, financial and pharmaceutical industries. Many of our graduate students go on to careers in academia as faculty members in universities around the world.

The use of statistics in many disciplines provides an opportunity for inter-disciplinary collaboration between the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability and other departments on campus. Our faculty members are actively engaged in interdisciplinary research in such areas as mathematics, computer science, biostatistics, environmental sciences, and financial mathematics and statistics. The [Statistical Laboratory (Statlab)](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/resources/statlab) provides the entire UCSB campus with access to expertise in data-analysis methodology, experimental and study design, and statistical computation. At the same time, the Statlab trains Statistics graduate students in statistical consulting. The [Center for Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Research (CFMAR)](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/cfmar/) provides international leadership in quantitative finance and insurance analytics.

## Faculty Research Interests

Our faculty members each bring a unique perspective to the department and have widely varying interests, specialties, and expertise. Specifically, our faculty’s research interests are as follows:

### [ANDREW CARTER](/people/andrew-carter)

Research interests include: asymptotic statistical inference, comparisons of statistical experiments, density estimation and nonparametric function estimation.

### [NILS DETERING](http://detering.faculty.pstat.ucsb.edu/)

Research interests include contagion effects in financial networks by asymptotic methods facilitating random graphs. He is also working in the area of infinite-dimensional stochastic analysis and its applications to mathematical finance. This work includes infinite dimensional polynomial processes, Markovian representations for Stochastic Volterra equations, Heath-Jarrow-Morton models for energy markets and their calibration with neural networks. Nils Detering recently also worked on an interdisciplinary project with a colleague from the department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at UCSB. This project aims at modeling serotonergic fibers and their densities in the brain.

### [RAISA E. FELDMAN](/people/raya-feldman)

Research interests include: stochastic differential equations with non-Gaussian noises, time series, filtering problems.

### [JEAN-PIERRE FOUQUE](/people/jean-pierre-fouque)

Research interests include stochastic processes, stochastic partial differential equations, waves in random media, financial mathematics.

### [ALEXANDER FRANKS](https://www.afranks.com)

Research interests include covariance estimation, Bayesian inference, sensitivity analysis, causal inference, and missing data. Application areas include the analysis of “omics” data, with a recent focus on proteomics, as well as applications in sports analytics with a focus on basketball.

### [MENGYANG GU](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmengyanggu)

Research interests include probabilistic models of multiple time series, images, spatio-temporal data and functional data, with emphasis on scalable computation and theoretical properties. His research projects broadly encompass topics in data science and machine learning, with applications in quantifying uncertain geological hazards, high-throughput material characterization, epidemic models, computer model emulation, and data inversion. 

### [DAWN HOLMES](/people/dawn-holmes)

### [JOHN HSU](/people/john-hsu)

Dr. Hsu continues to work on Bayesian estimation of covariance matrices. The Bayesian estimation for the linear mixed effects models, with a very flexible prior structure, has been fully developed. He is also working on a project of Bayesian methods in estimating ordered mortality rates. The project is interesting, however, the computation is challenging due to the constraints of the parameters.

### [TOMOYUKI ICHIBA](/people/tomoyuki-ichiba)

Research interests include: probability, stochastic processes, stochastic differential equations, collisions of Brownian particles, local time of semimartingales, rough paths, signature, mathematical economics &amp; finance (stochastic portfolio theory, mean-field game/control), data science in finance, molecular biology &amp; sports.

Research interests include a wide range of topics such as nonparametric methods, large sample theory, tests and efficiencies, directional data, censoring, spacings and goodness-of-fit methods. He is also investigating machine-learning tools and pattern recognition for high-dimensional data.

### [MICHAEL LUDKOVSKI](/people/michael-ludkovski)

Research interests include mathematical finance, actuarial science, and stochastic modeling. Some topics of recent research are computational finance, Monte Carlo methods, stochastic games, high-frequency trading, longevity modeling, renewable energy generation, Gaussian Process surrogates in finance, stochastic simulation, and numeric methods for stochastic control. Dr. Ludkovski collaborates with statisticians, actuaries, operations researchers and engineers.

### [WENDY MEIRING](/people/wendy-meiring)
