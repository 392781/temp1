# Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

At its core, our department views diversity and inclusion as critical within our mission to educate and prepare the future workforce of data scientists and quantitative thinkers. Increasing diversity across our field is essential in creating more productive, representative, and enriching outcomes as well as innovative solutions to critical problems. We recognize that historically, the job markets and academic communities in statistical theory and methods, financial mathematics, and actuarial science have been weighted toward racial, gender, and socioeconomically privileged communities. We are dedicated to correcting this imbalance in our own community.

**Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee**

The DEI committee is composed of staff, students and faculty who serve in various roles and capacities. The goals of the DEI committee are to incorporate DEI concerns into all department programs and processes, to track progress toward these goals, and to communicate progress to the faculty, staff and students. The DEI committee also serves as the central communications hub that bridges the social and academic life in the department. Three dedicated roles are assigned to the undergraduate, graduate and faculty diversity officers. The diversity officers are tasked with authoring and maintaining the department’s DEI action plan as well as overseeing its implementation with the approval of the department.
